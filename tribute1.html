			<h2 class="font">Here's a time-line of Daniel Day Lewis's Life:</h2>
			<ul class="font" style="text-align: justify;">
				<br>
				<li><b>1957</b> - Daniel Michael Blake Day-Lewis was born on 29 April 1957 in Kensington, London, the second child of poet Cecil Day-Lewis (1904–1972) and his second wife, actress Jill Balcon (1925–2009).</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1968</b> - In 1968, Day-Lewis's parents, finding his behaviour to be too wild, sent him as a boarder to the independent Sevenoaks School in Kent..</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1972</b> -For a few weeks in 1972, the Day-Lewis family lived at Lemmons, the north London home of Kingsley Amis and Elizabeth Jane Howard. Day-Lewis's father had pancreatic cancer, and Howard invited the family to Lemmons as a place they could use to rest and recuperate. .</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1975</b> -By the time he left Bedales in 1975, Day-Lewis's unruly attitude had diminished and he needed to make a career choice. Although he had excelled on stage at the National Youth Theatre in London, he applied for a five-year apprenticeship as a cabinet-maker..</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1982</b> - During the early 1980s, Day-Lewis worked in theatre and television, including Frost in May (where he played an impotent man-child) and How Many Miles to Babylon? (as a World War I officer torn between allegiances to Britain and Ireland) for the BBC..</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1989</b> - Day-Lewis progressed his personal version of method acting in 1989 with his performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan's My Left Foot..</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1996</b> - In 1996, Day-Lewis starred in the film adaptation of Arthur Miller's play, The Crucible reunited with Winona Ryder, and starring alongside Paul Scofield, and Joan Allen. During the shoot, he met his future wife, Rebecca Miller, the author's daughter.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>2002</b> - After a three-year absence from acting on screen, Day-Lewis returned to film by reuniting with Martin Scorsese for Gangs of New York (2002).</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>2007</b> - In 2007, Day-Lewis starred alongside Paul Dano in Paul Thomas Anderson's loose film adaptation of Upton Sinclair's novel Oil!, titled There Will Be Blood.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>2010</b> - Day-Lewis portrayed Abraham Lincoln in Steven Spielberg's biopic Lincoln (2012).</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>2012-16</b> - Shortly after winning the Oscar for Lincoln, Day-Lewis announced he would be taking a break from acting, retreating back to his Georgian farmhouse in County Wicklow, Ireland, for the next five years, before making another film.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>2017 and after</b> - After a five-year hiatus, Day-Lewis returned to the screen to star in Paul Thomas Anderson's historical drama Phantom Thread (2017). Set in 1950s London, Day-Lewis played an obsessive dressmaker, Reynolds Woodcock, who falls in love with a waitress (played by Vicky Krieps).[73] Prior to the film's release, on 20 June 2017, Day-Lewis's spokeswoman, Leslee Dart, announced that he was retiring from acting.[11][74] Unable to give an exact reason for his decision, in a November 2017 interview, Day-Lewis stated: "I haven't figured it out. But it's settled on me, and it's just there ... I dread to use the over-used word 'artist', but there's something of the responsibility of the artist that hung over me. I need to believe in the value of what I'm doing. The work can seem vital, irresistible, even. And if an audience believes it, that should be good enough for me. But, lately, it isn't."[75] On Day-Lewis's retirement, Anderson stated, "I would like to hope that he just needs a break. But I don't know. It sure doesn't seem like it right now, which is a big drag for all of us."[40] The film and his performance were met with widespread acclaim from critics, and Day-Lewis was again nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.</li>
